# Hospital-Emergency-Room Analysis
## 🚀 Tools: SQL · Excel · Power BI

## Project Background
Hospitals face ongoing challenges in managing emergency room (ER) performance, where high patient volumes, long wait times, and uneven resource allocation can lead to poor patient outcomes. This project was initiated to help hospital administrators and clinical leads monitor, evaluate, and optimize ER operations through a Power BI dashboard. The goal is to turn raw patient-level data into actionable insights that can drive timely, data-informed decisions across departments.

## 🎯 This Project Delivers Actionable Insights On:
#### * Peak visit times and staffing efficiency
#### * Average wait times and their impact on patient satisfaction
#### * Trends in patient admissions and department referrals
#### * Demographic patterns related to ER usage
#### * Service gaps and opportunities for operational improvements

## 🗂️ Data Structure & Initial Checks
#### * The dataset spans from April 2023 to October 2024, covering 9,216 patient records. Key columns include:
#### * Patient ID, Admission Date, Gender, Age, Race
#### * Wait Time, Satisfaction Score, Admission Flag
#### * Department Referral, Case Manager, and Hour of Arrival
### Initial checks involved:

#### * Handling missing values in race and referral fields
#### * Ensuring date formats were consistent
#### * Calculating derived fields like “Hour of Admission”
#### * Validating categorical values (e.g., gender, department)

## 📊 Executive Summary
Over 19 months, the ER handled 9,216 cases with an average wait time of 8.3 minutes and a patient satisfaction score of 4.99/10. The majority of visits occurred on Mondays, Saturdays, and Tuesdays, especially around 11 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM, and 11 PM.
Referrals were most common to General Practice and Orthopedics, though 5,400 patients didn’t require follow-up care. Nearly half of the patients were admitted.
Demographically, patients aged 20–39 formed the largest group, with a racially diverse population where White and African American groups were predominant.

## ✅ Recommendations
#### * Optimize staffing during peak hours and busy weekdays (especially Mondays and weekends).
#### * Reduce wait times by improving triage workflow and digital queue systems.
#### * Enhance patient experience by investigating low satisfaction scores, possibly via patient feedback surveys.
#### * Allocate more resources to departments like General Practice and Orthopedics, given their high referral volumes.
#### * Consider targeted outreach or education for underrepresented or high-visit age groups to improve preventative care efforts.
#### * ducation for underrepresented or high-visit age groups to improve preventative care efforts.
